# Searche

Simple search script that helps you find documents and things in your linux home environment.
This is just a simple C script that I created while I was bored in quarantine. 
I know it is not something special but for sake of learning a bit more about C and things you can do with it its just fine. 

All that it does you input name of the file and it finds it if is in your /home/{user} area.
